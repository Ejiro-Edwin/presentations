  	    The first innovation lab in Africa, Pulse Lab Kampala brings together
  	    data scientists, data engineers, partnership specialists, academics
  	    and technical experts to generate high impact data analysis tools to
  	    address development challenges. These innovative tools support UN partners
  	    and government in anticipating and responding to poverty, impacts of
  	    natural disasters, epidemics and food security by leveraging new sources
  	    of digital ‘Big Data’ (such as social media, mobile data, online
  	    information) and real-time analytics. Through partnerships, and in
  	    alliance with the Government, Pulse Lab Kampala acts as an ecosystem
  	    catalyst. In addition to keynoting regional conferences on data
  	    innovation, the Lab conducts learning sessions for UN partners and
  	    workshops for government and academic partners.
